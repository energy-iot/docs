Technical Story: Deploy dockerized OpenEMS securily on AWS

## Context and Problem Statement

Initially, all opensource docker containers were deployed on the same AWS ECR cluster to minimize dependency on particular cloud infrastracture.

Today, we decided to shift the database layer to AWS RDS to enable URL via terraform code for the PostgreSQL database so that the AWS ECR cluster can always have a fixed address for it.

This will enable to troubleshoot the OAuth configuration via Odoo.
Once that is working, team will consider enabling DNS so all containers be in ththe same ECR cluster.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* urgency: need working configuration by April 23, 2024
* concern: decouble db connectivity issue from Oddo configuration issue

## Considered Options

* [option 1]
add loadbalancer and DNS
* [option 2]
move database to RDS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1, because it is faster path to unblock configuration issue and does not prevent us to move to option 2 in the future.
### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* follow-up decision required

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
Adding more cloud managed services that minimaly needed to stay safe and scalable using IaC.
* [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …]
* …
